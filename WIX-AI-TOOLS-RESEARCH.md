## Key AI Tools Available in Wix Editor

### 2. Generate Full Page Text (from screenshot)

## What the AI Understands

Based on documentation, the AI responds to:
1. **Business type and description**
2. **Site type** (e.g., "bail bond agency")
3. **Tone of voice** preferences
4. **Design style** preferences
5. **Content requirements**

## Limitations

- AI Website Builder creates NEW sites only, cannot edit existing
- BUT: AI tools IN the Editor (text creator, section creator, theme assistant) CAN modify existing sites
- Full Page Text generator replaces text but keeps layout/structure

## Prompting Best Practices (Inferred)

1. Be specific about business type
2. Include key details visitors should know
3. Specify tone of voice
4. Describe the emotional response you want
5. Mention specific features/services
6. Include location/service area information
