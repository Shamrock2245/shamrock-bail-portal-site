# ElevenLabs Conversational AI Strategy

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the strategic implementation of ElevenLabs Conversational AI for Shamrock Bail Bonds. Our primary goal is to **automate routine intake**, **capture missed opportunities**, and **scale personal outreach** using high-fidelity voice synthesis.

---

## 1. Core Objectives

### A. 24/7 Infinite Intake ("The Intake Clerk")
*   **Problem**: Missed calls during peak hours or after-hours result in lost revenue.
*   **Solution**: An AI agent capable of handling concurrent calls.
*   **Persona**: "Sarah" (Standard Intake Clerk).
*   **Channels**:
    1.  **Web Widget**: Embed on `shamrockbailbonds.biz` for immediate browser-based calls.
    2.  **Inbound Voice**: Twilio number forwarding to ElevenLabs SIP trunk.

### B. High-Trust Personalization ("The Owners")
*   **Problem**: Generic AI voices lack the personal trust required for sensitive bail conversations.
*   **Solution**: Voice Cloning of key staff.
*   **Personas**:
    1.  **"Brendan" (Owner)**: Authority, reassurance, high-stakes negotiations.
    2.  **"Kayla" (Senior Agent)**: Empathy, detailed process explanations, follow-ups.

## 2. Implementation & Architecture

### A. The "Intake Clerk" Workflow
1.  **Trigger**: User initiates call (Web or Phone).
2.  **Conversation**:
    *   Identify Caller Intent (New Arrest vs. Check-in).
    *   Collect "Big 5" Data: Defendant Name, Jail/County, Charges, Indemnitor Name, Phone.
3.  **Data Handling**:
    *   **Webhook**: `post_call_transcription` sent to Google Apps Script.
    *   **Processing**: `ElevenLabs_WebhookHandler.js` parses the intent.
    *   **Action**: 
        *   Log to Slack (`#new-leads-ai`).
        *   Create Lead in CRM.
        *   SMS Notification to Staff ("Hot Lead: [Name]").

### B. Voice Cloning Strategy
**Objective**: Use cloned voices for specific, high-value touchpoints.

#### 1. "Brendan" (Owner Voice)
*   **Use Case**:
    *   **Welcome Message**: "Hi, I'm Brendan, owner of Shamrock. I know this is a tough time..."
    *   **Escalation**: When a user is hesitant or needs reassurance.
    *   **Outbound Drops**: Voicemail drops for high-value leads.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   30-60 minutes of high-quality audio training data.
    *   Authorized use only (Security restriction in `Code.js`).

#### 2. "Kayla" (Senior Agent Voice)
*   **Use Case**:
    *   **Detailed Explanations**: "Here is exactly how the court process works..."
    *   **Follow-Ups**: Check-in reminders or payment reminders.
    *   **Empathetic Intake**: Handling distressed callers.

## 3. Technical Stack

*   **Telephony**: Twilio (SIP Trunking / Elastic SIP).
*   **Backend**: Google Apps Script (Webhook Receiver).
*   **Database**: Google Sheets / Wix Collections.
*   **Notifications**: Slack (Internal), Twilio SMS (External).

## 4. Current Status
*   [x] **Backend**: Webhook Listener Deployed (`ElevenLabs_WebhookHandler.js`).
*   [x] **Strategy**: Defined.
*   [ ] **Phase 1**: Web Widget Deployment (In Progress).
*   [ ] **Voice Cloning**: Training Data Collection (Next Step).

## 5. "The Manus Project" (WhatsApp Facilitator)

### Objective
Leverage ElevenLabs v3 technology to create an intuitive, voice-first assistant on WhatsApp (`239-955-0178`) that handles bond signing, answers questions, and guides users through the workflow.

### Architecture (Asynchronous Voice Agent)
Unlike the real-time phone agent, "Manus" operates on WhatsApp text and voice notes.

#### The Stack
1.  **Platform**: WhatsApp Business API (via Twilio).
2.  **Brain**: OpenAI GPT-4o (Logic & Context).
3.  **Voice**: ElevenLabs Turbo v2.5 / Multilingual v2 (Text-to-Speech Voice Notes).
4.  **Backend**: Google Apps Script (Orchestrator).

#### Workflow
1.  **Input**: User sends a text question or a voice note ("How do I sign this?").
2.  **Processing**:
    *   GAS receives webhook.
    *   (If Audio) Whisper API transcribes voice note to text.
    *   OpenAI generates a helpful response.
3.  **Output (The Magic)**:
    *   **Text**: "Here is the link to sign: [SignNow Link]"
    *   **Voice Note**: "Hey [Name], Manus here. Just tap that link, scroll to the bottom, and sign with your finger. Let me know if you get stuck!" (Generated by ElevenLabs).

### Why Voice Notes?
*   **Trust**: Eliminates "bot fatigue". A voice note feels personal and reassuring.
*   **Clarity**: Complex instructions (like court dates or signatures) are easier to explain verbally.
*   **Speed**: Faster than typing long explanations.

### Implementation Plan
1.  **Configure Twilio**: Connect `239-955-0178` to WhatsApp Sandbox/Production.
2.  **Create "Manus" Voice**: Clone a professional, reassuring voice in ElevenLabs.
3.  **Backend Logic**: Update `SOC2_WebhookHandler.js` to handle WhatsApp messages.
4.  **System Prompt**: Deployed as `ElevenLabs_Manus_Prompt.md`.
