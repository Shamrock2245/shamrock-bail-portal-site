# SEO Optimization Guide 2026

**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Purpose:** Actionable SEO improvements for Shamrock Bail Bonds.

## 1. Terms of Service Linking

You have correctly added the "Back to Home" button and Footer link. This meets the core requirement of making the legal terms accessible.

**Checklist for ToS:**
- [x] Link in Footer (visible on all pages).
- [x] "Back to Home" or navigation on the ToS page itself.
- [ ] **Recommendation:** Ensure the ToS text itself includes a line at the top: *"Effective Date: January 1, 2026"* (or current date) to signal freshness to Google.

## 2. Image Alt Text Strategy

Since many images are set in the Wix Editor, copy/paste these optimized strings into the **Alt Text** field for your images.

| Image Location / Type | Optimized Alt Text to Copy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Site Logo** (Header/Footer) | "Shamrock Bail Bonds Logo - 24/7 Florida Bail Service" |
| **Hero Image** (Home Page) | "Professional Bail Bondsman service in Fort Myers, Florida - available 24/7" |
| **Team/Staff Photos** | "Licensed Shamrock Bail Bonds agent assisting a client" |
| **"Call Now" Button/Icon** | "Click to call Shamrock Bail Bonds for immediate jail release" |
| **Testimonial Avatars** | "Satisfied Shamrock Bail Bonds client review" |
| **Courthouse/Jail Photos** | "Lee County Jail and Courthouse exterior in Fort Myers" |
| **Map/Location Image** | "Map showing Shamrock Bail Bonds service area across all 67 Florida counties" |
| **Payment Icons** (Cards/Cash) | "Accepted payment methods for bail bonds: Cash, Credit, Payment Plans" |

**Pro Tip:** If you have an image of a specific county jail (e.g., Naples, Key West), mention that city specifically in the Alt Text.
